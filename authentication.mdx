# Authentication

The Yirifi.ai API uses Bearer token authentication. You'll need to include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request to access our endpoints.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.yirifi.ai/v1
```

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up for Yirifi.ai">
    Create your account at [yirifi.ai](https://yirifi.ai) if you haven't already.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access your dashboard">
    Log in to your [dashboard](https://yirifi.ai/dashboard) and navigate to the API Keys section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API key">
    Click "Generate New API Key" and copy the key securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your key">
    Make a test request to verify your API key is working correctly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Keep your API keys secure!** Never share them publicly or commit them to version control. Store them as environment variables in your applications.
</Warning>

## Making Authenticated Requests

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` prefix:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.yirifi.ai/v1/category"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.yirifi.ai/v1/category', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get('https://api.yirifi.ai/v1/category', headers=headers)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Authentication Errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive one of these error responses:

<ResponseExample>
```json 401 Unauthorized
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key",
  "code": "INVALID_API_KEY"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<ResponseExample>
```json 403 Forbidden  
{
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "API key does not have permission for this resource",
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  **Environment Variables**: Store your API key as an environment variable rather than hardcoding it in your application.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Key Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys for enhanced security. Generate new keys and update your applications before revoking old ones.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Rate Limiting**: Be aware of rate limits when making requests. See our [rate limiting guide](/guides/rate-limiting) for more details.
</Tip>

## Testing Your Authentication

You can test your API key with a simple request to any endpoint:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Test Request
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.yirifi.ai/v1/category" \
  -w "\nStatus: %{http_code}\n"
```

```javascript Test with JavaScript
async function testAuth() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.yirifi.ai/v1/category', {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
      }
    });
    
    if (response.ok) {
      console.log('Authentication successful!');
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log('Response:', data);
    } else {
      console.log('Authentication failed:', response.status);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Request failed:', error);
  }
}

testAuth();
```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
  **Success**: If your API key is valid, you'll receive a `200 OK` response with the requested data.
</Check>
